# GoChat - Multi-Container Deployment

> This is a fork of [LockGit/gochat](https://github.com/LockGit/gochat) with Docker Compose multi-container deployment support.

## What's New

This fork adds **production-ready multi-container deployment** to the original gochat project:

- ✅ **8 Independent Containers**: Each service (etcd, redis, logic, connect-ws, connect-tcp, task, api, site) runs in its own container
- ✅ **Horizontal Scaling**: Scale Logic, Connect, Task, and API services independently
- ✅ **Docker Compose**: One-command deployment with `make compose-dev` or `make compose-prod`
- ✅ **Auto-Configuration**: Container IPs automatically registered to etcd for proper RPC communication
- ✅ **Health Checks**: Each service monitors its own health with auto-restart
- ✅ **Dev/Prod Configs**: Separate configurations for development and production environments

### Quick Start

```bash
# Start all services
make compose-dev

# Or manually
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up

# Visit the chat app
http://localhost:8080
```

### Scaling Services

```bash
# Scale specific services
docker-compose up --scale logic=3 --scale connect-ws=2 --scale task=2
```

### Production Deployment

```bash
make compose-prod HOST_IP=<your-server-ip>
```

## Architecture

## Original README

### gochat is a lightweight IM server implemented using pure go

* gochat is an instant messaging system based on go. It supports private messages and room broadcast messages. It communicates between layers through RPC and supports horizontal expansion.
* Supports websocket and TCP access, and supports websocket and TCP message interworking.
* Based on etcd service discovery, making it convenient to scale and deploy.
* Using redis as the carrier of message storage and delivery is very lightweight.
* Because of Go's cross-compilation features, compiled binaries can run quickly on various platforms.
* Clear architecture and directory structure.

### Components

```
Language: golang
Database: sqlite3 (can be replaced with MySQL or other databases)
Database ORM: gorm
Service Discovery: etcd
RPC Communication: rpcx
Queue: redis (can be replaced with kafka or rabbitmq)
Cache: redis
Message ID: snowflake algorithm
```

```

### CI/CD Pipeline

#### GitHub Actions Workflow

Automated CI/CD pipeline for testing, building, and deploying GoChat:

- **Test**: Runs on every push and pull request
  - Go fmt check
  - Go vet static analysis
  - Unit and integration tests with coverage
  - Redis service container for tests

- **Build**: Builds Docker image after tests pass
  - Multi-stage Docker build
  - Image caching for faster builds

- **Push**: Pushes to Docker Hub (on push to branches)
  - Multiple tags: `latest`, `<branch>`, `<git-sha>`
  - Credentials via GitHub Secrets

- **Deploy**: Optional deployment to environments
  - Development: Auto-deploy on `dev` branch
  - Staging: Auto-deploy on `staging` branch
  - Production: Manual approval on `master` branch

#### Setup GitHub Secrets

Configure these in repository Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions:

**Required for Docker Hub:**
- `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` - Your Docker Hub username
- `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` - Docker Hub access token

**Optional for server deployment:**
- `DEV_SERVER_HOST`, `DEV_SERVER_USER`, `DEV_SERVER_KEY`
- `STAGING_SERVER_HOST`, `STAGING_SERVER_USER`, `STAGING_SERVER_KEY`
- `PROD_SERVER_HOST`, `PROD_SERVER_USER`, `PROD_SERVER_KEY`

#### Branch Strategy

- `dev` → Development environment (auto-deploy)
- `staging` → Staging environment (auto-deploy)
- `master` → Production environment (manual approval)

#### Manual Deployment

```bash
# Pull and deploy specific version
./scripts/deploy.sh dev latest
./scripts/deploy.sh staging abc123def
./scripts/deploy.sh prod latest
```
